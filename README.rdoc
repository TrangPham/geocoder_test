= The Geocoder Test Apps

This repository consists of some bare Rails apps used for testing the rails-geocoder gem (http://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder). The tests included with the gem attempt to simulate ActiveRecord and do a very poor job. These apps can be used to better test geocoder with multiple Rails versions and database types.

The <tt>/base</tt> directory contains the actual meat: the geocoded model, the database migration, the unit tests, and the fixtures. Each of the apps contains symbolic links to these files in the base directory. The base directory also contains some sample database.yml files which you can link to from each app. Note that because the same migration file is used for the different apps you can re-use the same test databases (no need to create different databases for different Rails versions).

The rails-geocoder gem is installed a plugin in each app, and is checked out directly from the repository as a Git submodule.

To run the tests, go into an app directory (eg: <tt>rails300)</tt>, create a valid <tt>config/database.yml</tt> file, create and migrate your database (development and test environments) and run the unit tests (eg: <tt>rake test:units</tt>).
